# Embodied AI Paper Reading

My research work currently lies in [Human Motion Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.10894) and Control. This list will mostly contain papers related to this field. Also, I will include some interesting papers from other fields in embodied ai.

Wonderful articles for understanding the basics of generative models (especially for green hand):

1. [Understanding Variational Autoencoders (VAEs)](https://towardsdatascience.com/understanding-variational-autoencoders-vaes-f70510919f73)

2. [Bayesian inference problem, MCMC and variational inference](https://towardsdatascience.com/bayesian-inference-problem-mcmc-and-variational-inference-25a8aa9bce29)
